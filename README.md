This is the repo that I made to demonstrate the basics of Laravel.

It goes over creating Models, Controllers, and Views using Vue.JS.

You can find the resources for everything we go over at the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6)

Topics we will be going over in no particular order

* [Routing](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/routing)
* [Models](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent)
* [Controllers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/controllers)
* [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/blade)
* [Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/passport)

While we won't be talking about the specifics of Vue.JS in the class we will be using it. More on Vue can be found at [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/)

In this repo, there are several branches that will go over where we should be at the end of any given part. The completed product after the 3 hour session is in the part 3 branch.
